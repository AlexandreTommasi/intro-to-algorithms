🌟 Welcome to the Algorithms 1 - C++ Exercises repository! 🌟

This collection includes all the programming exercises and assignments from my Algorithms 1 course. Each exercise is designed to reinforce fundamental concepts in C++ programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures. 🖥️💡

This repository is a great resource for anyone looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking. 🧠✨

Feel free to explore the code, try out the exercises, and contribute with your own solutions or improvements! 🚀💻
